# Distancer

Distancer is a Geo-distance calculator that I designed for a work project.  It takes distances from two different text files, calculates the distances between "nodes" and "cities", and outputs which cities are within a predetermined range of a node.  This is used primarily for performance optimisation and cost-efficiency of node placement.
